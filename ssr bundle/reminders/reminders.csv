NLP,NLP Suite welcome & system requirements,Welcome to the NLP Suite a package of Python 3 and Java tools designed for text processing and visualization. The Suite requires several FREWARE software components in order to run. You will need to download and install them.\n\n1. JAVA. Several scripts are based on the FREEWARE Java. You can download and install Java at https://www.java.com/en/download\n\n2. STANFORD CORENLP. The core text analyses of the NLP Suite are based on the FREEWARE Stanford CoreNLP. You can download Stanford CoreNLP at https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/download.html.\n\n3. GEPHI. The visualization of network graphs requires the installation of the FREEWARE software Gephi. You can download and install Gephi at https://gephi.org/users/download/\n\n4. GOOGLE EARTH PRO. The visualization of geographic maps requires the installation of the FREEWARE software Google Earth Pro. You can download and install Google Earth Pro at https://www.google.com/earth/versions/#download-pro.\n\n5. MALLET. Mallet topic modelling requires the installation of the FREEWARE Mallet. You can download and install Mallet at http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/download.php.\n\n6. WORDNET. Aggregating and disaggregating words requires the installation of the FREWARE WordNet. You can download WordNet at https://wordnet.princeton.edu/download/current-version.,No,Yes
NLP,NLP Suite architecture & filenames,The Python scripts in the NLP Suite have filenames that clearly identify the Suite architecture.\n\nThe filename suffix designates three different types of files: main GUI and util.\n\nmain files are the only ones that you can run in command line independently of others; they will call both GUI and util files.\n\nGUI files lay out on the screen the widgets of a script for easy Graphical User Interface (GUI).\n\nALL SCRIPTS SUFFIXED BY main CAN BE RUN INDIPENDENTLY OF THE NLP SUITE. Thus on command line you can type\nPython annotatormain.py\nAnd it will fire up the annotator GUI independently of NLP_main.py.\n\nThe filename prefix cluster together scripts used for the same purpose. Thus annotator identifies all files dealing with html annotation.,No,Yes
NLP,NLP Suite reminders,Several NLP Suite scripts will fire up reminders for the user. You can turn them off once you are familiar with a script. You can always turn any reminder back ON (or OFF for that matter) if you select the reminders dropdown menu at the bottom of each GUI and then select a specific reminder (if reminders are available for that GUI).,No,Yes
NLP,NLP Suite IO options in GUIs,You do not need to select IO options in the main NLP GUI. You will have to enter these values again in the GUI opened by a specific tool. Only for those Menu options marked as NO GUI you will need to enter IO information directly on the NLP GUI.,No,Yes
SVO,SVO output,"Depending upon the options you select, the SVO pipeline will produce in output different types of files: cvf files, wordcloud image, Google Earth Pro map, and Gephi network graph.\n\nWhile cvf and png files are easy to read, less so are Google Earth Pro kml files and, particularly, Gephi gexf files.\n\nPLEASE, read the Gephi TIPS file before you run the SVO pipeline.",No,Yes
SVO,SVO input,"The SVO pipeline allows you to start from a TXT file in input and extract from it via OpenIE the SVOs and visualize them.\n\nBut you can also select a CSV file in input, the output file previosuly created by OpenIE characerized by the suffix '-svo.csv', and use that file to visualize the results without having to rerun OpenIE.",No,Yes
SVO,SVO system requirements,The extraction and visualization of SVOs requires several software components.\n\n1. The extraction of SVOs requires the Stanford CoreNLP set of NLP tools. You can download the FREEWARE Stanford CoreNLP at https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/download.html.\n\n2. CoreNLP requires to have the Java installed. You can download and install the FREEWARE JAVA at https://www.java.com/en/download/\n\n3. The visualization of the SVO output as GIS maps and network graphs further requires the installation of the FREEWARE software Gephi and Google Earth Pro.\n\n3a. You can download and install the FREEWARE GEPHI at https://gephi.org/users/download/\n\n3b. You can download and install the FREEWARE GOOGLE EARTH PRO at https://www.google.com/earth/versions/#download-pro,No,Yes
Excel,Excel Charts,"The Excel chart to be displayed has hover-over effects (i.e., when you hover the mouse over chart points some information will be displayed).\n\nFirst, hover-over charts are based on Excel macros. You need to enable macros in Excel to view the chart (read the TIPS file on how to do this).\n\nSecond, if the Excel chart has nothing in it or chart titles are not displayed, you need to hover the mouse over the chart area to display the chart properly. That is how hover-over charts work.",No,Yes
GIS,GIS Nominatim geocoder,"If the Nominatim geocoder service exits with the error 'too many requests', you can break up the csv location file and process each subfile for geocoding as normal csv files.",No,Yes
GIS,Google Earth Pro download,The GIS pipeline requires a copy of the FREEWARE Google Earth Pro installed on your machine.\n\nYou can download and install the FREEWARE GOOGLE EARTH PRO at https://www.google.com/earth/versions/#download-pro,No,Yes

*,csv files,"If csv ouput files open displaying weird characters in a Windows OS (e.g., aâ‚¬), most likely the cause is due to non utf-8 compliant input text. Apostrophes and quotes are the typical culprits, but also other punctuation characters.
